<h2>Embree Overview</h2>

<p>Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels,
developed at Intel. The target user of Embree are graphics application
engineers that want to improve the performance of their application by
leveraging the optimized ray tracing kernels of Embree. The kernels
are optimized for photo-realistic rendering on the latest Intel&reg;
processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and the 16-wide Xeon Phi&trade;
vector instructions. Embree supports runtime code selection to choose
the traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction
set of your CPU. We recommend using Embree through its API to get the
highest benefit from future improvements. Embree is released as Open
Source under the <a
 href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0
license</a>.</p>

<p>Embree supports applications written with the Intel SPMD Programm
Compiler (ISPC, <a
 href="http://ispc.github.com">http://ispc.github.com</a>) by also
providing an ISPC interface to the core ray tracing algorithms. This
makes it possible to write a renderer in ISPC that leverages SSE, AVX,
AVX2, and Xeon Phi&trade; instructions without any code change. ISPC
also supports runtime code selection, thus ISPC will select the best
code path for your application, while Embree selects the optimal code
path for the ray tracing algorithms.</p>

<p>Embree contains algorithms optimized for incoherent workloads (e.g.
Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms) and coherent workloads
(e.g. primary visibility and hard shadow rays). For standard CPUs, the
single-ray traversal kernels in Embree provide the best performance
for incoherent workloads and are very easy to integrate into existing
rendering applications. For Xeon Phi&trade;, a renderer written in
ISPC using the default hybrid ray/packet traversal algorithms have
shown to perform best, but requires writing the renderer in ISPC. In
general for coherent workloads, ISPC outperforms the single ray mode
on each platform. Embree also supports dynamic scenes by implementing
high performance two-level spatial index structure construction
algorithms.</p>
        
<p>In addition to the ray tracing kernels, Embree provides some
tutorials to demonstrate how to use the <a href="api.html">Embree
API</a>. The example photorealistic renderer that was originally
included in the Embree kernel package is now available in a separate
GIT repository (see <a href="renderer.html">Embree Example
Renderer</a>).</p>
