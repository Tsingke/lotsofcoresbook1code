<h2>Compiling Embree on Linux and Mac OS X</h2>

<p>Embree requires the Intel SPMD Compiler (ISPC) to compile. We have
tested ISPC version 1.6.0 and 1.7.0, but more recent versions of ISPC should
also work. You can download and install the ISPC binaries from <a
 href="http://ispc.github.com/downloads.html">ispc.github.com</a>. After installation, put
the path to the ispc executable permanently into your PATH.</p>
      
<p><pre><code>export PATH=path-to-ispc:$PATH</code></pre></p>

<p>You additionally have to install CMake and the developer version of
GLUT. Under Mac OS X, these dependencies can be installed using
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>:</p>

<p><pre><code>sudo port install cmake freeglut</code></pre></p>

<p>Under Linux you can install these dependencies
  using <code>yum</code> or <code>apt-get</code>. Depending
on your Linux distribution, some of these packages might already be
installed or might have slightly different names.</p>

<p>Type the following to install the dependencies using <code>yum</code>:</p>
 <p><pre><code>sudo yum install cmake.x86_64
sudo yum install freeglut.x86_64 freeglut-devel.x86_64
sudo yum install libXmu.x86_64 libXi.x86_64 
sudo yum install libXmu-devel.x86_64 libXi-devel.x86_64</code></pre></p>

<p>Type the following to install the dependencies using <code>apt-get</code>:</p>
 <p><pre><code>sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev</code></pre></p>
        
<p>Finally you can compile Embree using CMake. Create a build directory
and execute "ccmake .." inside this directory.</p>
        
<p><pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..</code></pre></p>

<p>This will open a configuration dialog where you can perform various
configurations as described below. After having configured Embree,
press c (for configure) and g (for generate) to generate a Makefile
and leave the configuration. The code can be compiled by executing
make.</p>

<p><pre><code>make</code></pre></p>

The executables will be generated inside the build folder. We
recommend to finally install the Embree library and header files on
your system:

<p><pre><code>sudo make install</code></pre></p>

<p>If you cannot install Embree on your system (e.g. when you don't
have administrator rights) you need to add embree_root_directory/build
to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and SINK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH in case you
want to use Embree on Xeon Phi&trade;).</p>

<p>The default configuration in the configuration dialog should be
appropiate for most usages. The following table described all
parameters that can be configured:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Default Value</th></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_TUTORIALS</td>     <td>Builds the C++ version of the Embree tutorials.</td><td>ON</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_TUTORIALS_ISPC</td><td>Builds the ISPC version of the Embree tutorials.</td><td>ON</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</td>    <td>Can be used to switch between Debug mode (Debug) and Release mode (Release)</td><td>Release</td></tr>
  <tr><td>COMPILER</td>            <td>Select either GCC, ICC, or CLANG as compiler.</td><td>GCC</td></tr>


  <tr><td>RTCORE_INTERSECTION_FILTER</td><td>Enables the intersection filter feature.</td><td>ON</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTCORE_BUFFER_STRIDE</td>      <td>Enables buffer stride feature.</td><td>ON</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTCORE_RAY_MASK</td>           <td>Enables the ray masking feature.</td><td>OFF</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTCORE_SPINLOCKS</td>          <td>Enables faster spinlocks for some builders.</td><td>OFF</td></tr>

  <tr><td>XEON_ISA</td>            <td>Select highest ISA on Xeon&trade CPUs (SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX-I, AVX2)</td><td>AVX2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>XEON_PHI_ISA</td>        <td>Enables generation of Xeon Phi&trade; version of kernels and tutorials.</td><td>OFF</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You need at least Intel Compiler 11.1 or GCC 4.4 to enable AVX and
Intel Compiler 12.1 or GCC 4.7 to enable AVX2.</p>

<p>If you want to compile Embree for Xeon Phi&trade; you need the
Intel Compiler. Enabling the buffer stride feature reduces performance
for building spatial hierarchies on Xeon Phi&trade;.</p>

 <h2>Compiling Embree on Windows</h2>

 <p>Embree requires the Intel SPMD Compiler (ISPC) to compile. We have
 tested ISPC version 1.6.0 and 1.7.0, but more recent versions of ISPC should
 also work. You can download and install the ISPC binaries from <a
  href="http://ispc.github.com/downloads.html">ispc.github.com</a>. After
 installation, put the path to ispc.exe permanently into your PATH
 environment variable. You have to restart Visual Studio for this
 change to take effect.</p>
      
  <p>For compilation of Embree under Windows use the Visual Studio
  solution file embree.sln. The project compiles in 32 bit and 64 bit
  mode. The solution is by default setup to use the Microsoft
  Compiler. You can switch to the Intel Compiler by right clicking
  onto the solution in the Solution Explorer and then selecting the
  Intel Compiler. We recommend using 64 bit mode and the Intel
  Compiler for best performance.</p>
      
  <p>In Visual Studio, you will find 4 build configurations, Debug
  (for SSE2 debug mode), Release (for SSE2 release mode), ReleaseAVX
  (for AVX release mode), and ReleaseAVX2 (for AVX2 release
  mode). When using the Microsoft Compiler you can only use the Debug and
  Release configuration. For enabling the ReleaseAVX configuration you
  need at least Intel Compiler 11.1 and for the ReleaseAVX2
  configuration you need at least Intel Compiler 12.1.</p>
  
  <p>Most configuration parameters described for the Linux build can
  be set under Windows by commenting out the appropiate lines in the
  common/sys/platform.h file.</p>

  <p>We recommend enabling syntax highlighting for the .ispc source
  and .isph header files. To do so open Visual Studio 2008, go to
  Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> File Extension and add the isph
  and ispc extension for the "Microsoft Visual C++" editor.</p>
