<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<p>Embree supports Windows (32bit and 64bit), Linux (64 bit) and Mac
  OS X (64 bit). The code compiles with the Intel Compiler, the Microsoft
Compiler, GCC and CLANG. Using the Intel Compiler improves performance
by approximately 10%. Performance also varies across different
operating systems. Embree is optimized for Intel CPUs supporting SSE,
AVX, and AVX2 instructions, and requires at least a CPU with support
for SSE2.</p>

<p>The Xeon Phi&trade; version of Embree only works under Linux in 64bit
mode. For compilation of the the Xeon Phi&trade; code the Intel Compiler is
required. The host side code compiles with GCC, CLANG, and the Intel
Compiler.</p>
