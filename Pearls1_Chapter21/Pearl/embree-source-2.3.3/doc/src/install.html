  install the Embree library.</p>

<h2> Installing Embree on Linux and Mac OS X</h2>

<p>To install the Embree libray and Embree header files on your system
type the following:</p>

<p><pre><code>sudo ./install.sh</code></pre></p>

<h2> Linking ISPC applications with Embree</h2>

The precompiled Embree library uses the multi-target mode of ISPC. For
you ISPC application to properly link against Embree you also have to
enable this mode for your application. You can do this by specifying
multiple targets when compiling your application with ISPC:

<p><pre><code>ispc --target sse2,sse4,avx,avx2 -o code.o code.ispc</code></pre></p>
